# Ship Berthing Location Optimization in MiniZinc

This repository contains a MiniZinc-based solution for optimizing the berthing locations of ships in a port. The objective is to allocate berths efficiently to minimize delays, reduce transit time, and optimize port resources. This project is part of an AI course, applying constraint programming to solve real-world scheduling challenges
